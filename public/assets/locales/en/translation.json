As a subdivision of AI, machine learning (ML) systems build algorithms based on sets of sample data and deliver forecast, without being exclusively programmed to do so. What's more, these algorithms change and adapt in response to emergance of new data or alteration of conditions. \n\n This autonomous learning ability is at the core of today’s enterprise. It’s increasingly used to take major decisions and drive automation. Even though ML is closely associated with statistical analysis and data mining—and there are often overlaps across these disciplines—what sets ML apart is the capabilitly to detect patterns, trends and properties that would otherwise go unnoticed or remain unreachable. Essetially, ML focuses on known knowledge and ways to put it to use more effectively.",
    "text2": "How to Choose the Best Machine Learning Software",

It’s best to assess your organization’s needs, including the type of ML you require.

This includes whether your company can benefit from a conventional method or deep learning, what programming languages are needed, and which hardware, software and cloud services are necessary to deploy and scale a model properly. \n\n One of the key decisions comes from the underlying machine learning framework, which typically includes one of four approaches: \n\n Sci-Kit Learn:  A user-friendly and highly flexible open-source framework that nevertheless delivers sophisticated functionality. \n\n H2O: ML framework that’s open source and heavily slanted to decision support and risk analysis. \n\n TensorFlow: An open source and highly modular framework created by Google. \n\n PyTorch: A more intuitive open source framework that incorporates Torch and Caffe2, integrated with Python.",

The drag-and-drop platform incorporates highly automated ML for both data scientists and business domain users.

    "subtitle": "CEO at Everbestlab LLC",
    "text1": "In today's world of project management, Agile stands as one of the most popular approaches due to its flexibility and evolutionary nature. It started back in 2001 with the Agile manifesto and was originally made for software development. Over time, agile project management evolved and became a common choice for many project managers, regardless of the industry. \n Agile, to sum up, is an iterative and incremental way of managing projects that enables teams to keep up with the demands of the contemporary workplace. It involves various methodologies and all of them are based on the concepts of flexibility, transparency, quality, and continual improvement.",
    "text3": "Below are the top advanatages of Agile and why it is adopted by many companies for managing their projects:",
    "title1": "1. The right product",
    "text4": "Unlike previously managed projects which heavily relied upon very detailed technical requirements upfront, Agile project management sets out to iterate over what works and what does not. In this approach, the client stays involed in the development process and can ask for changes depending on realities. This will result in the creation of the product that is needed by customer and overall superior quality in the end.",
    "title2": "2. Better control",
    "text5": "Agile enables project managers to gain greater transparency, quality-control features and integration of feedback. High standard is maintained throughout the implementation phase of the project and all stakeholders are involved in the process with daily progress reports through advanced reporting tools and techniques.",
    "title3": "3. Customer satisfaction",
    "text6": "In the Agile, the end-used is involved at all time in the decision-making process which brings about higher customer retention. In the conventional frameworks, the customer is brought only in the planning stage and cannot influence execution which affects the flexibility and adaptability. By maintaining the customer in the loop and making alterations based on their feedback, one delivers value to the customer and ensures that the end product is genuinly according to their requirements.",
    "title4": "4. Greater predictability",
    "text7": "With increased transparency, projecting risks involved, and suggesting effective mitigation plans will turn easier. Within Agile, there are better ways to detect and predict risks and plan to make sure that the project runs smoothly. \nScrum methodology, for example, uses sprint backlogs and burndown charts to increase the visibility of the project which enables managers to anticipate performances and plan accordingly.",
    "text7.1": "",
    "title5": "5. Minimized risks",
    "text8": "In theory, projects employing an Agile methodology will never fail. Agile works in small sprints that focus on continuous delivery. There is always a small part that can be salvaged and used in the future even if a particular approach doesn’t go as planned. \nIn a nutshell, the benefits of Agile are numerous. This ranges from improvments in the quality of the product to helping the team members perform better. This methodology, if used correctly, prevents pitfalls like excessive cost and scope creep. \n\n If you think Agile fits for your next project, you are in the right path!"

    "text1": "In contemporary era, nobody likes dealing with paperwork. That’s especially the case when you have just set up a business and there are a hundred and one things to do. \nDocument management could probably be be the least of your concerns, but if it isn’t done properly it may lead to a number of problems for your business further down the line. \nNow is the time to get the planning right and put in place best practice processes that will support your company’s growth.",
    "text4": "We take a closer look at why electronic records management is vital for your start-up business:",
    "title1": "1. It’s highly efficient",
    "text5": "Having a good electronic document management system will improve both internal efficiency and your overall business competiveness. \nThere’s nothing more distracting or frustrating than having piles of physical documents and files lying around. And not being able to find what you need could ultimately harm your reputation.\nAn Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) will ensure records aren’t lost, and help you get any information or data you need quickly and reliably.",
    "title2": "2. It’s cost effective",
    "text6": "Saving money wherever possible is key for any start-up, and storing documents electronically is a cost effective way to manage all your records. \nManual document management is a time consuming back office process and you’d be much better placed freeing up internal resources and costly staff time. Reallocate them instead on more important and productive tasks that will help strengthen and build your business. \nThere are also costs associated with physical storage, particularly as a fast growing business will generate a plethora of files. Switching to digital storage will allow you to cost effectively manage expansion needs.",

    "title3": "3. You Control the document flow",
    "text11": "Electronic document management has special feature namely document flow. When a new document enters into the system, it is then tracked, respective departments and their employees are assigned to the documents. This means highly productive workplace, where business document oprations function at ease. The system will also allow the status and currect department a document is involved, which enables to manageement to stay on track and make decisions accordingly.",

    "title4": "4. It protects your business",
    "text12": "Finally, an EDMS is the safest way to store documents and files. There have been a number of high profile data breaches in recent years, and your business needs to protect sensitive financial information and trusted customer details with a secure system. \nIt also has the added value of providing an offsite backup, in case of any disaster in the office which could destroy both physical and electronic files at your premises. \nElectronic records management is a vital asset for the administrative function of any company, large or small. If you haven’t got a process in place yet, it makes good business sense to set one up as soon as possible. Find out more about Kefron’s Electronic Document Management System solution here."

Nor did we have the intention to burden investment in something that people ultimately did not need. Therefore, it was a bit harder to decide on which features to include in the initial version.

We used Kotlin and Swift to develop the app for Android and iOS platforms, respectively. Java 11 was used for the backend development and ReactJS for the frontend development. We also incorporated ElasticSearch for efficient search functionality, Thumbor for image processing, and AWS RDS and S3 for storage and database management. \n\n Throughout the development process, we tested the app thoroughly, making improvements to the user interface, performance, and security.
